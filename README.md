# coding
All of my coding for everything I do:
- Decal is everything for the BIG Intro to investing Decal.
- Finance has all of my finance based projects in it.
- jupyter_notebooks is a hodgepodge of a bunch of random practice things.
- practice is all of my practice files for anything from pandas to regex.
- q is for the q programming language. Still learning it.
