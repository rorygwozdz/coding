This folder contains all of my finance project folders.

So far, I've got:
- Bonds - has nothing in it. Intended yield curve build out.
- Clusters - based off "does the stock market overresact to news". Turns out, statistically, things get and stay wild for longer than you'd expect assuming a random distribution of 3sd moves.
- GCG - has a trading journal and a couple ways for getting VaR and Log/Log graphs for every company in the s&p 500.
- MP4F - based off of the eponymous textbook. Needs cleaning. Going to build a project/script for each chapter.
- Trader - Pet project for practicing how to be a better trader. Check the readme for it.
- VIX - not sure what's in this. Will check it out later.
