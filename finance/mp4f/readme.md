This is mostly for learning and sort of to prove I can learn.

Inside is my work for each of "Mastering Python For Finance". PDF included.

If you dig it, feel free to copy my notes & work plus build upon it.

Each chapter has a .md with with my notes as well as anything I built out. Mostly, I imagine, homework and "follow along" projects.
