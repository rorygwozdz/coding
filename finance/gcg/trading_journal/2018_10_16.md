Today I bought in to Sprint. 5 puts for February, 220 worth at 10 cents. I had thought about buying the calendar for jan/feb but that seemed like a bad idea mostly because I don't want to be short gamma if this merger fails before before then, before feb.
The OI on the trade makes me think January is when the thing is intending to go through anyway, so that'd have been a shitshow waiting to happen. Totally okay, of course, since I'm no longer gonna be nail biting for new years.

On another account, I think this is the first step towards the new GCG strategy. Oh, and something came up in class. I'm thinking of pulling data on optionable, high price to cash, CCC companies. In a rising rates environment, those companies (broadly) are fucked. A portfolio of puts on them would be, if otm, likely very profitable. Especially if they've little cash on hand.

I'll think through it more, but that's where my heads at now. I'm trying to think how to set this strategy up to most profit from my options knowledge. Maybe a rolling, off earnings month strategy of calendar spreads? i.e. sell before buy a month after, as things fall apart, reportedly, in during the earnings call?

Again, thoughts and thoughts and thoughts.
