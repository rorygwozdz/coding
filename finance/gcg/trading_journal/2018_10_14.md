    Okay, so there was another final point that might just be the nail in the coffin for the double click strategy.

    Essentially, I totally forgot that we can't, literally _cannot_, afford to be assigned the puts we sold. That modeling question, that inbetween, we pay up for. How? What do we do? Well, we step in to the market and buy it back Friday. We do not get good pricing here. The market makers know we're short gamma, and we get fucked on that. We pay up for that.

    So I think we are going to have to find a better way to allocate this money. Yikes.

    Vol's high though. I like being a net seller here. I'll put in some thought to it tomorrow.  


    Some thoughts: hedging is critical. If you're ever thinking something is flying off the handle, bet the other way. "I'm missing out" translates to the opposite trade of what ever you're missing out on. Keeping this has helped immensely clarify my thoughts and actions. Roll with your gut, if the logic is unclear.

    Lastly, hope is not a strategy. Not in investing, not in life. If hope is your plan, that's a bad plan. Plans have steps towards action. Hope only has a leap of faith.
