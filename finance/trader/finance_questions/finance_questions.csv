A portfolio manager is considering two stocks. Stock A has an annual expected return of 10% and an expected standard deviation of 20%. Stock B has an annual expected return of 15% and an expected standard deviation of 30%.

What should the manager do if she wishes to minimize the volatility of the portfolio?

"A regression of a time series of monthly American Airline returns (RAA)on the variables fuel prices (FP) and average passenger revenue/mile (PR) results in the following equation: RAA = 0.056 - 0.0036 FP + 0.0118 PR where there are 120 data points, the standard error of the intercept is 0.035, the standard error of the coefficient of fuel price is 0.001 and the standard error of the passenger revenue/mile is 0.005. Which variables, if any, are significant?"

What is the probability that the rate of return of this stock will fall below zero for a given month? What range of values would be expected using a 95% confidence interval?

What is your net position? How would you create a delta-gamma neutral portfolio?"
