Okay, let's get started.

_This_ is for _you_. It's one of those side projects developed solely to better you in not only its creation but also in its culmination and more over in its use.

The contents of this folder are a collection of python scripts designed to make you a better trader.

They will be used to:
- sharpen your mathematics skills
- keep you current with the news
- quiz your financial knowledge
- test your probability abilities
- test your market making

In pursuit of this you'll need a few scripts, a couple csvs, and a csv folder.

1. news_updater.py (done)
    * asks for a summary of the news, commentary on products you're loooking at, and stores interesting links for you.
2. mather.py (done)
    * quizzes you on multiplication and percentages. records your scores and write them to a csv
3. fin.py
    * asks you the definition of a financial concept and an example of why it's important. Saves answers to csv. Has further application to iterating on better answers.
4. probability.py
    * the mother of an agglomeration of probability questions. Will ask for an answer and for tips on how to approach it. tips will appear in the future on similar problems. godspeed.
5. market_maker.py
    * asks you a bunch of market making questions. will iterate with an extra guy trying stepping in and asking you a new price. this one will be about fruit.
6. option_quizzer.py
